# Spielberg vs Burton

## Who has the best ratings?

Here we want to analyse IMBD ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton and understand who has the best ratings.

We will use hypothesis testing to analyse if the mean IMBD rating for the two directors are the same.

 H0: IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same  
 Ha: IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are different


```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
library(scales)
```

 
```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

We calculate the confidence intervals for both director's rating and plot a graph of the latest: 

```{r}
CI_directors <- movies %>% 
  filter((director == "Tim Burton") | (director == "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 
  group_by(director)%>%
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(rating),
    SD_rating = sd(rating),
    count_rating = n(),
    SE_rating = SD_rating/sqrt(count_rating),
    t_crit = qt(0.975, count_rating-1),
    CI_low = mean_rating -t_crit * SE_rating,
    CI_high = mean_rating +t_crit * SE_rating
  )
CI_directors <- data.frame(CI_directors)
CI_directors$director <- factor(CI_directors$directo, levels = c("Tim Burton","Steven Spielberg"))

CI_directors %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(y = director, 
                    x = mean_rating,
                    xmin = CI_low, 
                    xmax = CI_high,
                    color = director), width = 0.1, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean_rating,
                 y = director,
                 color = director), size = 5) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#7FD3EB", "#F08080"))+
  labs(
    title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",
    subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",x = "Mean IMDB Ratings", y = ""
      ) +
  geom_text(aes(x = mean_rating, y = director, label = sprintf("%.2f", mean_rating)), vjust = -2, color="black", size=4.5)+
  geom_text(aes(x = CI_low, y = director, label = sprintf("%.2f", CI_low)), vjust = -2, color = "black", size = 3.5)+
  geom_text(aes(x = CI_high, y = director, label = sprintf("%.2f", CI_high)), vjust = -2, color = "black", size = 3.5)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = CI_directors[2,8],xmax = CI_directors[1,7], ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), color = "grey", alpha = 0.3)+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```

We run test statistics for both directors:

``` {r, t-test}

Steven_Tim<-movies %>%
  filter((director == "Tim Burton") | (director == "Steven Spielberg"))

t.test(rating~director, data = Steven_Tim)

set.seed(1234)
ratings_in_null_world <- Steven_Tim %>%
  specify (rating ~ director) %>%
  hypothesize (null = "independence") %>%
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate (stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

ratings_in_null_world %>%
  visualise()

ratings_in_null_world %>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = 0.64, direction ="both")

```
According to this confidence interval there is a difference between the IMBD ratings of the directors. The graph shows us that Steven Spielberg seems to have higher mean ratings than Tim Burton.

**Congrats Steven!**
