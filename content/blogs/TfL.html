<h2>Solving the mystery of May &amp; June 2020</h2>
<p>Here we will explore data about TfL bike’s rental from 2015 to 2020. Our main goal is to identify and understand changes in bike rentals compared to expectations</p>

  clean_names() %&gt;% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %&gt;%

<p>For May and June 2020, we see higher levels of bike rentals than expected and also higher rentals than we saw for most of the years prior to 2020. This is likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as during Q2 of 2020, when people got to go outside for a bit after some restrictions were lifted, many took the opportunity to get some fresh air by renting bicycles during the warmer months of the year, resulting in much higher actual rental figures than expected figures, and higher figures than most of the years prior.</p>
<p>We then plot a graph that will show the monthly changes in TfL rentals:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate the expected rentals per month 
bike_monthly_average &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year&gt;2015) %&gt;% 
  group_by(month) %&gt;% 
  summarize(monthly_average = mean(bikes_hired))

# Calculate the average rentals per year &amp; month 
bike_monthly_average_by_year &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year&gt;2015) %&gt;% 
  group_by(year,month) %&gt;% 
  summarize(monthly_average = mean(bikes_hired))

# Combine both expected and actual rentals per year &amp; month   
bike_joint &lt;- bike_monthly_average_by_year %&gt;%   
  inner_join(bike_monthly_average, by = &quot;month&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    fill_up = if_else(monthly_average.x &gt; monthly_average.y, monthly_average.x - monthly_average.y, 0),
    fill_down = if_else(monthly_average.x &lt; monthly_average.y, monthly_average.y - monthly_average.x, 0)
  )

# Create a graph to visualise expected versus actual rentals  
bike_joint %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=month)) +  
  geom_line(aes(y=monthly_average.x, group = 1), size = .1) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=monthly_average.y, group = 1),size = .8, colour = &quot;blue&quot;) + 
  facet_wrap(~year)+ 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = monthly_average.y, ymax = monthly_average.y + fill_up, group = 1),fill = &quot;#7DCD85&quot;, alpha = .4) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = monthly_average.y - fill_down, ymax = monthly_average.y, group = 1), fill=&quot;#CB454A&quot;,alpha= .4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = &quot;Monthly changes in TfL bikes rentals&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Change from monthly average shown in blue\nand calculated between 2016-2019&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: TfL, London Data Store&quot;, y = &quot;Bike rentals&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;) +
  NULL</code></pre>

On that graph we can see in blue the monthly bike hired, i.e. what we would expect. The black lines represents the actual hired and the green and red areas show excess or deficit compared to what is expected.</p>
<p>Now we plot another graph that will show the weekly changes in TfL rentals:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate the expected rentals per week
expected_rentals &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year&gt;2015) %&gt;%
  mutate(week=if_else(month == &#39;Jan&#39; &amp; week == 53, 1, week)) %&gt;%
  group_by(week) %&gt;% 
  summarize(expected_rentals = mean(bikes_hired))

# Calculate the average rentals per year &amp; week 
actual_rentals &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year&gt;2015) %&gt;%
  mutate(week=if_else(month == &#39;Jan&#39; &amp; week == 53, 1, week)) %&gt;%
  group_by(year,week) %&gt;% 
  summarize(actual_rentals = mean(bikes_hired))

# Combine both expected and actual rentals per year &amp; week    
bike_joint_week &lt;- actual_rentals %&gt;%   
  inner_join(expected_rentals, by = &quot;week&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    percentage_change = ((actual_rentals - expected_rentals)/expected_rentals),
    fill_down = if_else(percentage_change &lt; 0, percentage_change, 0),
    fill_up = if_else(percentage_change &gt; 0, percentage_change, 0),
    scale_colour=if_else(fill_up &gt; 0, &quot;#7DCD85&quot;,&quot;#CB454A&quot;))

# Replicate expected graph  
bike_joint_week %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week)) +  
  geom_line(aes(y = percentage_change, group = 1),size = .1)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+ 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = fill_down, group = 1),fill = &quot;#CB454A&quot;, alpha = .5) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = fill_up, ymax = 0, group = 1),fill = &quot;#7DCD85&quot;, alpha = .5) +
  annotate(geom = &quot;rect&quot;, xmin=13, xmax=26, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf, alpha=0.15) +
  annotate(geom = &quot;rect&quot;, xmin=39, xmax=53, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf, alpha=0.15) +

  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 53), breaks = c(13, 26, 39, 53))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(-.5, 1), breaks = c(-.5, 0, .5, 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = &quot;Weekly changes in TfL bikes rentals&quot;, subtitle = &quot;% change from weekly averages\ncalculated between 2016-2019&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: TfL, London Data Store&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;, x = &quot;week&quot;) +
  NULL</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/TfL_files/figure-html/tfl_percent_weekly-1.png" width="2880" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>On that graph we can see in green and red the deviations from the weekly average.</p>
