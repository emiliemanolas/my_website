# Terraria

## My Fabulous Game

This is a game I coded as part of a university project.

You can play it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/emiliemanolas/96c17fadcec4b83c60a489a9e5657cf1/terraria-game.ipynb)

You see, our world was once a fruitful and exciting place.\nThat is, until the DEN (Dark Evil Nation) attacked. With their terrible monsters and spiteful warlocks they brought pain, suffering,\nand sorrow onto our beautiful land and you are our last hope. We need your help to fight these terrible monsters and answer difficult enigmas posed by the evil warlocks.\nWhat do you say? Are you in? The land of Terraria depends on you!")

This place used to be where children came to play, shows were put on, and it was full of life.\nHowever, since the DEN have invaded, it has become a hub for these twisted monsters.\nOnly the bravest dare to go through it, and very few make it out alive.")

You have made it past the Dark Forest!\n\nOn your way out of this dreadful place you are blinded by something reflecting the sunlight into your line of sight.\nYou turn to look and see, very far into the distance, a beach. You decide to investigate.\nUpon arrival, you are confronted by a tall, repulsive man who appears to be a warlock. You know you must get to the castle,\nbut it is far away, located on an island only reachable by boat. The man agrees to take you,\non the condition that you answer an enigma. Be careful! Fail to answer correctly and you will upset him,\nwe don’t know what this evil warlock is capable of!")

You have successfully answered the evil warlock’s enigma.\n\nIt was not easy, and your success renders you a strong competitor. But will you be victorious this time?\nArriving on the island of the Treacherous Castle, you have no choice but to follow the sharp and broken down path up to the gates.\nIn order to succeed in this mission, you have to kill the final monster and outsmart the final warlock.\nTheir strength and wit are nearly impossible to outweigh, so get ready for the biggest mental and physical battle of your life!")

Thanks to their special ears, they have extremely developed hearing. \nPossibly strong enough to hear the answers of enigmas from listening to the warlock’s thoughts.\nTo fight monsters, they throw special stones that explode when they make contact with their target.")

He has many abilities and uses his magical powers to outsmart any monster. \nThey are extremely intuitive and therefore are good at solving enigmas. Use magic to fight your opponent, \nbut be careful to take breaks or you will drain all your powers at once and risk death!")

The dwarf is able to outsmart large, clumsy monsters and use their own strength against themselves. \nChoose to be a dwarf and you will not be disappointed! Dwarves are agile little creatures, very good at stealing, \nand this might prove useful when it comes to solving enigmas! The dwarven axe is its weapon of choice, \na wooden and metal axe with a sharp pick.")
